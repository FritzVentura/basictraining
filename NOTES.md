Assignment

You are going to do these things, one at a time, in pairs!
After each step, run the code, and confirm the contents in the console.

1. Create an string - with your team-name! (preferably not more than 10 characters)
2. Convert it into an array
3. Create a for-loop that iterates through the array, and writes each letter to the console
4. Now create a function for writing a single letter to the console - name it writeLetter, and call it with a single parameter for the letter to write
5. Replace the inner part of the for-loop with a call to that function
6. Now, below the for-loop, create a .forEach that iterates through the array of letters, and calls writeLetter for each one.
7. Make another .forEach that doesnâ€™t call your writeLetter function, but an anonymous function that does the same thing.
8. Make a third forEach, that uses an arrow-function - note how similar it is to the anonymous function

Make sure you get the difference between calling the named function, calling the anonymous one, and using an arrow-function - as well as the similarities.

9. Make a function - name it upper, that receives a string as parameter, and returns the upperCase version of that string

10.
